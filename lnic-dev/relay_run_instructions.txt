To test the lnic register read/write interface:

1. Build and run the switch server:
    cd /home/vagrant/firechip/lnic-dev/simple-switch
    ./build_switch_programs.sh
    ./simple_switch
2. In a new terminal, run the switch client:
    cd /home/vagrant/firechip/lnic-dev/simple-switch
    ./simple_client
3. In a new terminal, build and run the register relay test:
    cd /home/vagrant/firechip/lnic-dev/lnic-tests
    ./build_tools.sh
    ./run_custom_test.sh register_relay
4. In a new terminal, run the register relay initializer test:
    cd /home/vagrant/firechip/lnic-dev/lnic-tests
    ./run_custom_test.sh initiate_register_relay

You should see every lnic transmission from each end of the relay mirrored
by the switch client's standard output.
